Forward progress items on my list:

- Implement a method of versioning for the database
- Flesh out the command interpreters
-- Come up with a way to re-use core command interpreter code to prevent code duplication
-- Core Interpreter (in-game commands), Nanny Interpreter (pre-login), Editor Interpreter (writing, notes, OLC stuff, etc.)
-- Custom Interpreters - Scripted items, rooms, mobiles, etc. may have their own custom command interpreters for doing contextual
   things when you're in, near, or using them.
-- Chaining Interpreters - Come up with a way to chain interpreters so that a command will pass through multiple interpreters
   until it finds one that satisfies the command.
