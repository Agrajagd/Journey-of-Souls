List of Design concepts for JoS:

- Main Game class is a thread which is simply the game loop.
- Server class is a thread which listens on the designated port number and
  accepts new connections. New connections are then spawned into their own
  Descriptor threads.
- Descriptors are threads that are specific to each connected player and are
  what keep track of each player's input and output for the game.
- Each Java-backed command is an individual class that conforms to the contract
  of the Command interface.

- The game will primarily be scripted in JavaScript once all of the core objects
  and systems are completed in Java. (See: SCRIPTING_NOTES.txt)
- A lot of JoS will be event-driven and there will be quite a lot of events that
  can be scripted. (See: EVENTS.txt)
