Journey of Souls (JoS) is a multi-threaded game server with support for multiple
simultaneous client connections. The class which contains the listening socket
is a singleton thread object that is constantly listening for and accepting
new connections.

When a client connects, the server thread spawns a client "Descriptor" thread
that holds all of the details on the connected client. Descriptors are
organized within the Server Thread in a HashMap that ties the player's
Character name to the Descriptor for easy access. Until a player character name
is available, Descriptors are placed in a "nanny" collection that facilitates
the authentication and/or character creation workflows.
