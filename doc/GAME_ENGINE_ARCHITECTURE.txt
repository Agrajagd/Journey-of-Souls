Quick Bullet Points:

- Core Code Only: Keep as much out of this layer as feasible.
- Embedded Scripting: A Scripting Language (hopefully JavaScript via Rhino) will
	power most of the scriptable events within the game.
- MySQL Backed: Game data will be stored in a MySQL Database.
- Generic: Nothing game-specific should be in the codebase. It should be
  possible to build entirely different games based off the same codebase.
