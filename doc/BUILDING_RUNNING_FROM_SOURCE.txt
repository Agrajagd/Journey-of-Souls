- This codebase was developed in the NetBeans IDE. The build files generated by
  NetBeans assume a few things about how the build takes place. You can find
  these assumptions within the nbproject/private/ directory. If you reconfigure
  the project settings as described below, NetBeans should replace the files in
  this directory. Please don't commit these files.

- The first assumption is that the top-level project directory is the working
  directory for compilation. When you build the project, you need to do it from
  here. NetBeans should do this part automatically, if you're using it.

- The second assumption is that the working directory for running the project
  is the dist directory. You can set this value in the project properties or
  you can just run "java -jar JourneyofSouls.jar" from within the dist
  directory. This is so that it will pick up log4j and josmud.properties. These
  files are moved from config to dist as part of the build process.
