To setup a new test instance of the JoS DB:

1. Run the SQL in sql/init_db.sql
2. Run the SQL in sql/init_data.sql
3. Apply all of the files in sql/patches/ in order

To create a new patch, create a file with the name sql/patches/patch_`date +%s`.sql
and place your SQL statements for the changes you're making / have made to the DB
in that file.

If, for some reason, you're working on this codebase on a Windows machine, you can
replace `date +%s` with the current UNIX Epoch Timestamp by visiting: www.unixtimestamp.com
